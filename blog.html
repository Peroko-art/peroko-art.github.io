			<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Living your life facilitates art.</span>
			When I look at art that inspires me, I tend to think "Oh, why didn't I think of that?"
			or "How did the author conceptualize it? How long did it take them? What are all the things they had to take into account when making it?"
			It seems typical for one to look at the piece as a product to be consumed, rather than a remaining record 
			of a creative process. However, I believe art's purpose really is self-expression.
			Art is whatever makes your soul experience itself.
