		<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Living your life facilitates art.</span>
		When I look at art that inspires me, I tend to think "Oh, why didn't I think of that?"
		or "How did the author conceptualize it? How long did it take them? What are all the things they had to take into account when making it?"
		It seems typical for one to look at the piece as a product to be consumed, rather than a remaining record 
		of a creative process. However, I believe art's purpose really is self-expression. I recently spoke with an artist of many decades
		and we had a discussion on what art is. What I walked away with was a sense that not even someone with a degree and years of experience
		can accurately define art. To me, body piercing and game development are arts; to a classical pianist, they may not be.
		Art is whatever makes your soul experience itself.

	<p class="thoughts">
		<span style="text-decoration:underline;">Derealization</span>
		Sometimes I feel like I'm a nervous system that's been inserted into a random body, having to navigate
		life via it.
